# Spam Email Detection Model

This project demonstrates a simple machine learning model for spam email detection using `scikit-learn`.

## Project Structure

- `spam_detection.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the model implementation, training, evaluation, and prediction examples.
- `README_ML_Model.md`: This README file.

## Setup Instructions

To run this Jupyter Notebook, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:

- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`
- `jupyter`

### Installation

1.  **Install Python (if not already installed):**
    Download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

2.  **Install required libraries:**
    Open your terminal or command prompt and run:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas scikit-learn jupyter
    ```

## How to Use the Jupyter Notebook

1.  **Start Jupyter Notebook:**
    Navigate to the directory where you saved `spam_detection.ipynb` in your terminal and run:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

2.  **Open the Notebook:**
    Your web browser will open, showing the Jupyter Notebook dashboard. Click on `spam_detection.ipynb` to open it.

3.  **Run the Cells:**
    Execute each cell in the notebook sequentially. You can do this by clicking on a cell and pressing `Shift + Enter`, or by selecting "Run All" from the "Cell" menu.

    The notebook will:
    - Load a dummy dataset (you can replace this with a real dataset).
    - Preprocess the text data using TF-IDF.
    - Train a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier.
    - Evaluate the model's performance.
    - Provide examples of predicting whether new emails are spam or ham.

## Model Details

- **Algorithm**: Multinomial Naive Bayes
- **Feature Extraction**: TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)
- **Libraries Used**: `pandas`, `scikit-learn`

## Customization

- **Dataset**: You can replace the dummy dataset with your own email dataset (e.g., a CSV file with 'text' and 'label' columns).
- **Model**: Experiment with other `scikit-learn` classifiers (e.g., `LogisticRegression`, `SVC`, `RandomForestClassifier`) to see if you can achieve better performance.
- **Feature Engineering**: Explore more advanced text preprocessing techniques or feature engineering methods.
